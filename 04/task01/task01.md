# Task 1

### Task 1: Start a docker container for a redis server:

1. build on a chosen redis imageÂ `redis`
2. run the server

To complete the task we have to previously have installed docker in our computer, after that we have to download the redis image by executing `docker pull redis`.

After this we have to create the server and run it, now let's execute `docker run -d --name redis_server redis`

To verify that the server was created correctly we have to go to the docker desktop app and search for it on containers.![](C:\Users\scast\AppData\Roaming\marktext\images\2022-04-12-11-11-07-image.png)

As we can see the server has been created and it is empty.
